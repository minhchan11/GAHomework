* Data Visualization: Create visual tools to understand the dataset by regions, years, etc
* Regression: How does factors such as location, areas, numbers of rooms... correlate to a property's price
* Machine Learning: Create an algorithm to predict the property price, using the supplied training and testing set
* Presentation: Powerpoint or a Flask/Shiny Web App the Zillow Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1). However, as the data set is too large, may attempt to randomize for a smaller sample.
